Demonstrative web application written in modern __Python 3__ using
[Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/).


## Development requirements
- [python](https://www.python.org/): to install Django and its modules
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): required by _bower_
- [bower](https://bower.io/): to handle dependencies found in bower.json

## Set up a local development environment
For detailed install instructions, see
[the wiki page](https://gitlab.com/davcri91/softhub-site/wikis/installation-guide),
otherwise read the following **installation Overview**.  

**Note**: this guide is tested on Arch Linux that use python3.x as default.  
Run these commands from the project folder:

``` bash
# create a directory for the virtualenv
virtualenv ENV
# activate the virtualenv
source ENV/bin/activate
# install python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install bower if necessary
npm install -g bower

# install web dependencies with bower
bower install

# run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# run a custom Sothub command to iniialize the database
# https://gitlab.com/davcri91/softhub-site/blob/master/softhub/management/commands/populate.py
python manage.py populate


# runs the local development server
python manage.py runserver
```

The following files are used to store dependencies:  
`requirements.txt`: contains python dependencies  
`bower.json`: contains external JS and CSS libraries, used by bower  
`.bower.rc`: configuration file for bower, used to tell bower where to store dependencies

## Standard and conventions
Code is written trying to follow PEP8 standard: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

## Management commands
Generate models diagrams (you'll need Graphviz installed):
``` bash
python manage.py graph_models -a -o models.png
```
